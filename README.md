The projects aims at:

(a) Finding the Information Gain:
    
    Finding the entropy based of the features so that rank the features and predict whether there are zero bugs or non zero bugs. The dataset was already converted into mathematical form.

(b) Implementing the K Mean Clustering.

(c) Finding out the Silhouette Value.
